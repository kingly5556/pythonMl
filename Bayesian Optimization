Introduction to bayesian optimization
-What is bayesian optimization?
    Advanced method for hyperparameter tuning that balances exploration(searching new regions)and exploitation(refining promising regions).
    Uses a probabilistic model guide the search or optimal hyperparameters
    How It works:
        Surrogate model
            Builds a probabilistic model(e.g.,gaussian process)of the objective function based on prior evaluations
        Acquisition Function
            Balances exploration and exploitation by choosing the next hyperparameters to evaluate based on predicted performance and uncertainty
        Iterative refinement
            Updates the surrogate model after each evaluation,refining the search
    Why use Bayesian Optimization?
        Efficient for high-dimensional and expensive-to-evaluate functions
        Reduces the number of evaluations required to find near-optimal hyperparameters

Using Libralies for Bayesian Optimization
-Popular Libaries
    Hyperropt
        Simplifies bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning
        Works with fmin to minimize objective functions over a parameter space
    Optuna
        Flexible and user-friendly libary for hyperparameter optimization
        Supports dynamic search spaces and pruning of unpromising trals

Understanding Exploration vs Exploitation
-Exploration
    Focuses on sampling hyperparameters from unexplored regions.
    Useful for identifying new areas of high potential.
-Exploitation
    Focuses on refining the search around regions with known high performance.
    Useful for fint-tuning near-optimal hyperparameters
-Bayesian Optimization's Advantage
    Balances thes approaches using the acquisition function to minimize unnecessary evaluations while improving result.
