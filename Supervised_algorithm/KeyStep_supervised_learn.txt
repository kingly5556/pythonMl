1.model selection 
-choose appropriate model based in the problem
2.model evaluation
-use performance metrics like MSE for regression or accuracy,precision,recall and f1 score for classification
3.comparision
-compare multiple models to identify the best-performing one

Dataset Options 
1.regression Example 
-predict house prices using features like square footage,number of rooms,and location
-dataset likes California Housing 

2.classification Example
-classify Customer churn based on Customer demographic and behavior
-dataset likes Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Evaluating and comparing model performance
Steps
-evaluate models using cross-validation
-generate performance metrics
-summarize findings to identify strengths and weaknesses of each model
