What is feature creation?
    feature creation involves deriving new,meaningful features from existing ones to enhance a 
    model's ability to capture important patterns in the data
Exams of feature creation  
    Date-time feature,interaction feature,aggregations
Importance 
    Adds domain knowledge to the dataset    
    Captures hidden patterns and trends not evident in the original features

What is feature transforamtion?
    Feature transformation modifies existing features to better suit the learning algorithm
Common transforamtion
    Logarithmic transformation
        Reduces skewness in highly skewed distributions
    Square root transformation
        Moderately Reduces skewness,often used for count data
    Polynomial transformation   
        Add  higher-order terms(x^2,x^3)to capture non-linear relationships
Importance  
    Enhances the model's ability to fit non-linear relationships
    Makes distributions more nomal-like,aiding algorithms that assume normality
