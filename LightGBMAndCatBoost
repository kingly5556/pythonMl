Overview of CatBoost
-What is Catboost?
    Gradient Boosting libraly developed specifically to handle categorical features with out the need for preprocessing like one-hot encoding 
    Key Features of Catboost:
        Native Support for Categorrical Data
        Ordered Boosting 
        Robust to Overfitting
    Advantages
        Eliminates the need for manual encoding of categorical data
        Reduces overfitting with robust boosting techniques
        Easy to implement for datasets with many cateforical features
    When to use catBoost
        Datasets with a high proportion of categorical features
        Applications where overfitting is a concern
