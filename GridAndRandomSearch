What is grid search?
    Method of hyperparameter tuning that systematically evaluates all posible combinations of hyperparameter values within a specified grid.
    How it works:
        Define a range of values for each hyperparameter.
        Train and evaluates the model on each bombination of hyperparameter values.
        Select the combination that yields the best performance.
What is Random Search?
    Altternative method where hyperparameter combinations are sampled randomly from the specified ranges.
    How It Works.
        Define ranges of distributions for each hyperparameter.
        Randomly sample a specified number of combinations.
        Train and evaluate the model for each sampled combination

Practice Guidance on Choosing Search Ranges
-Start with Broad Ranges
    Use Random search to explore large parameter spaces and identify promising ranges
-Refine with grid search
    Narrow the search space based on Random Search results and perform exhaustive Grid Search for fine-tuning
-Understand Model sensitivity
    Somy hyperparameters(e.g.,Learning rate)require fine granularity,while other(e.g.,number of trees)can have coarser steps.
