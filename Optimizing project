Apply All Learned Tuning and Optimization Techniques

Comprehensive Model Optimization
    Data Preprocessing:
        Ensure data is clean,scaled,and encoded appropriately
    Feature Engineering:
        Derive new features and select the most important ones
    Regularization:
        Avoid overfittung by penalizing complex models
    Cross-validation
        Use techniques like K-Fold or Stratified K-Fold for robust performance metrics
    Hyperparameter Tuning
        Use methods like GridSearchCV,RandomizedSearchCV,or Beesian Optimization

Evaluating and Interpreting Model Performance
    Performance Metrics
        Classification
            Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1-Score,ROC-AUC
        Regression
            Mean Squared Error(MSE),Mean Absolute Error(MAE),R*R
        Importantce of Interpretability
            Use feature importance and coefficient analysis for transparency
