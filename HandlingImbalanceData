What is imbalanced data
-refers to datasets where one class significantly outnumbers the other(s)
-challenges with imbalanced Data
    Bias Toward Majority Class:
        Machine learning models tend to prioritize the majority class due to its frequency
    Misleading Evaluation metrics
        Metrics like accuracy can be misleading,as they do not account for class imbalance
    Insufficient samples for the minority class can lead to undefitting
Applications with imbalanced data
    fraud detection,medical diagnosis,and anomaly detection

Texhniques To handle
-Resampling Techniques
    Oversampling
        Increase the number of minrity class samples by duplicating or synthesizing new samples
        Exam:SMOTE(Synthetic minority Over-sampling Technique),which generates synthetic examples
    Undersampling
        Reduce the numver of majority class samples to balance the dataset
        Risk:Loss of valuable information from majority class
-Algorithm solution
    Class Weights
        Assign higher weights to the minority class during model training
        Many algorithms(Logistic regression,random forest)have built-in support class weights
    Anomaly detection models
        Treat the minority class as anomalies,focusing the model on detectig them.
-Evaluation Metric for Imbalanced data
    F1-score
        Harmonic mean of precision and recall,focusing on both false positives and false negative
    ROC-AUC
        Measures the ability to distinguish between classes across various treshold values
    Precision-Recall curve
        Focuses on performance for the positive class
